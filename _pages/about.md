Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hi, my name is Yu-Shu Chen, but I also go by Richard.

I recently graduated from UC San Diego with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and a minor in Cognitive Science. I am broadly interested in improving machine learning models’ interpretability and cognitive abilities, such as memory, learning, and reasoning, drawing inspiration from our understanding of the human brain to inform AI development. Specifically, I am currently working on enhancing AI systems’ reasoning capabilities by exploring how smaller models can function as different types of memory within larger systems. My long-term goal is to advance machine learning toward artificial general intelligence and apply it to science, engineering, and health.

You can find more details about the projects I’m currently working on in the Projects page. Feel free to reach out to me via email at <em>ysc283816 [at] gmail [dot] com</em> if you'd like to discuss ideas, collaborations, or anything else.
