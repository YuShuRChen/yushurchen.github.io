This blog is meant to document what I think on various topics, and help me develop writing skills (a very minor part of the purpose). I aim to keep posts short and straightforward for ease of reading. I'm not a great (nor fast) writer (yet) and it usually takes me a long time to write something before I am satisfied with it, but I sometimes don't have the time or patience to sit down and write for a long time, so you may feel like some posts have lots of unorganized ideas or the writing aren't great (this post is meant to be a demonstration of what that may look like). I'll come back and make sure it's there when I have time (which is never, lol. jk). I sometimes use writing tools like ChatGPT and Grammarly to help with grammar and phrasing, especially when I revisit posts to clean them up. 

If my thoughts on a topic change, my current plan is to cross out things that no longer apply (not delete) and add in new thoughts. This is not only to keep track of how my thoughts changed but also to keep me from making statements that I may regret later on (not that I usually do).
