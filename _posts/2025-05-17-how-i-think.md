Before I begin, I want to define these words as I'm using them in this post, just for clarity here, since people might use them differently elsewhere. These are based on Merriam-Webster but adapted slightly: 
- **Thought**: a product of thinking — a momentary mental reflection or consideration. Thoughts can be fleeting and unstructured. 
- **Idea**: a formulated thought — more developed and structured, often something that can be examined or evaluated. Ideas can be thoughts one comes up with or come from other people's beliefs. 
- **Belief**: something one holds to be true, at least tentatively — a more stable position formed after some evaluation or reasoning.

Like everyone else, I have pre-existing beliefs. When I encounter a new idea, I go through a process before accepting or rejecting it. 

The process follows the scientific method: **observe**, **identify problem**, **research**, **experiment (reasoning & evidence)**, **conclude**. Importantly, new ideas must be supported by stronger reasoning or better evidence than what I believe in order for me to update my beliefs. This mirrors the burden of proof in philosophy and the roles of the null and alternate hypotheses in statistics: the default position stands unless a stronger alternative emerges. 

This process matters for more than just figuring out what's true or false. The scientific method represents a disciplined way of thinking—one grounded in structured curiosity, logical consistency, and a willingness to revise. While we often associate it with empirical science, it's just as relevant to philosophy, ethics, and personal reflection. Even when we're dealing with concepts that can't be measured in a lab, we can still question assumptions, evaluate internal coherence, and adjust our views over time. Philosophy, in that sense, isn't separate from science—it's a domain that follows the same spirit. Thoughtful, structured reasoning is how we make progress, regardless of the topic. It's not just about having the right answers, but about asking better questions—and being ready to change when the answers surprise us. 

One key point is that this broader process does not prove things to be absolutely true or false. It relies on evidence and observation to support or refute hypotheses and theories, all of which are open to revision when new information emerges. That's why beliefs, even well-reasoned ones, must remain open to change. Holding beliefs too tightly, without leaving room for better ideas, undermines the entire process of growth and understanding. In addition, just because I don't hold a belief, or even disagree with it, doesn't mean I can't understand or sympathize with it. Part of evaluating ideas fairly means engaging with them on their own terms, not just defending my own position. 

If you have a different view on how we should come to believe what we do, I'd love to hear from you. I'll apply the same process and see where it leads me. 

Hope you enjoyed reading my first post!
